## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm that guy, I'm Lionel! ðŸ˜„ 

Throughout my career, I've delved into a wide range of technologies, from the classics to the cutting-edge, and everything in between. This little space of Github is my playground where I share projects that I hope fellow developers will find useful. 

ðŸ”­ I also fork numerous repositories to learn from the amazing work of others because learning is truly fun and inspiring. ðŸŒ±
